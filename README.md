### 1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

2.  Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
3.  Manually run them locally before pushing code
4.  Run them all after all development is completed


Answer: 
Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed makes most sense. By using github Actions, it would make the most sense to run the automated tests whenever we push code so that we can ensure that any new changes don't break the app later down the road.
